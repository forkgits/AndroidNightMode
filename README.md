It's a demo for Android Night Mode.

It has three ways:

* UiModeManager.setNightMode()
* Change Theme （Can refer to [MultipleTheme](https://github.com/dersoncheng/MultipleTheme)）
* Use [NightModeHelper](https://gist.github.com/slightfoot/c508cdc8828a478572e0)

Please make sure switch one way at one time. It means that you can switch to night mode, back to day mode, and then change to another way. Otherwise, it may cause something unpredictable.
